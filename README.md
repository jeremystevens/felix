# Welcome to Felix! ðŸŽ®

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ Let's learn how to use Felix, your new coding friend! It's super easy and fun!

## Using the Felix IDE (Your Coding Playground)

1. **Starting the IDE**
   - The Felix IDE window will pop up
   - This is where you'll write your code!

2. **Writing Your Code**
   - The big white box in the middle is where you type your code
   - The black box at the bottom shows what your program does when it runs

3. **Saving Your Work**
   - Click "File" at the top
   - Choose "Save" or "Save As" to keep your work safe
   - Give your file a name ending with `.fx` (like `mygame.fx`)

4. **Running Your Program**
   - Click "Run" at the top
   - Choose "Run Program"
   - Watch what happens in the black box below!

## Let's Write Some Code! ðŸš€

### Your First Program
Try typing this in the white box:
```
print "Hello! I'm coding!"
```
Run it and see what happens!

### Making Variables (Like Magic Boxes)
Variables are like boxes where you can store things:
```
age = 10
name = "Felix"
print age        # Shows what's in the age box
print name       # Shows what's in the name box
```

### Math Time! ðŸ”¢
You can do math just like a calculator:
```
x = 5
y = 3
print x + y  # Adds: 5 + 3 = 8
print x - y  # Subtracts: 5 - 3 = 2
print x * y  # Multiplies: 5 * 3 = 15
print x / y  # Divides: 5 Ã· 3
```

### Making Choices (If-Then)
Tell your program to make decisions:
```
age = 10
if age > 8
    print "You're a big kid!"
else
    print "You're still little!"
```

### Counting with Loops
Want to count numbers? Use a while loop:
```
count = 1
while count < 5
    print count    # Prints: 1, 2, 3, 4
    count = count + 1
```

## Fun Projects to Try! ðŸŒŸ

### Make a Greeting Card
```
name = "Felix"
print "******************"
print "* Hi, " + name + "! *"
print "* You're awesome! *"
print "******************"
```

### Number Guessing Game
```
secret = 7
guess = 5

if guess < secret
    print "Too low!"
if guess > secret
    print "Too high!"
if guess = secret
    print "You got it!"
```

## Tips for Success ðŸŒˆ
- Save your work often!
- If something doesn't work, check your spelling
- Have fun experimenting with different numbers and words
- If you get stuck, try running your program to see what's happening

Now you're ready to start coding! Remember, the best way to learn is to try things out and have fun! ðŸŽ¨

Happy Coding! ðŸš€
